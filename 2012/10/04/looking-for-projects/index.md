**With pythonpackages.com winding down, I am now actively seeking
projects for Q4 2012 and beyond.**

I am good at:

-   Deploying Plone sites:
    <http://blog.aclark.net/2012/10/03/plone-4-3-alpha-1-in-production/>
-   Maintaining and releasing Python packages:
    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=aclark&submit=search>
-   Cat herding volunteers:
    <http://lists.plone.org/pipermail/plone-com/Week-of-Mon-20120903/000039.html>
-   Writing documentation:
    <http://docs.pythonpackages.com/en/latest/index.html>
-   Writing narrative text:
    <http://www.packtpub.com/plone-33-site-administration/book>
-   Writing Python code: <https://github.com/aclark4life>

Also, I\'ve put together a list of projects I am involved in (or have
been involved in): <http://resume.aclark.net/projects/>, and please feel
free to check out my résumé: <http://resume.aclark.net/>. If you\'d like
to discuss how I can help you or your team, please get in touch:
<aclark@aclark.net>.
