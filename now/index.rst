What I'm doing now
==================

(Inspired by http://sivers.org/now)

I'm in Bethesda, MD, USA; I spend all my time on the following activities (in order of time spent and priority):

- **Husband** to Amy
- **Owner** of pets Mina (cat) & Quincey (dog)
- **Systems Administrator** at NIH
- **Partner, Python Web Developer** at ACLARK.NET
- **President & Executive Director** at DC Python
- **Webmaster & Executive Committee Member** at Parkwood Residents Association
- **Musician** at Headstraight

If my activities or priorities change, I'll update this page. Last update was January 2017.
