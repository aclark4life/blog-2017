What I'm doing now
==================

(Based on http://sivers.org/now)

I'm in Bethesda, MD, USA; I spend all my time on the following activities (in order of time spent and priority):

- **Husband** to Amy
- **Owner** of Pets (One cat, one dog)
- **Systems Administrator** at NIMH/NIH
- **Partner, Python Web Developer** at `ACLARK.NET, LLC <http://aclark.net>`_
- **President & Executive Director** at `DC Python <http://dcpython.org>`_
- **Musician** at `Headstraight <http://headstraight.net>`_
- **Webmaster & Executive Committee Member** at `Parkwood Residents Association <http://parkwoodresidents.org>`_

If my activities or priorities change, I'll update this page. Last update was June 2017.
