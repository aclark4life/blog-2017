My Plone Days October 2007
==========================

.. post:: 2007/10/18

My focus will be `PloneSoftwareCenter (PSC)`_. After receiving a little prodding on IRC, I am declaring myself the owner of `PSC`_. I'll spend my first two days working on `PSC`_ and getting it ready to ship with Plone 3 compatibility.
